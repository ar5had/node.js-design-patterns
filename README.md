## Chapter 1

### Immutable object
 If you want to create immutable object, **const** is not enough, so you should use ES5's method `Object.freeze()` or deep-freeze module.


### Getters and Setters
```js
const person = {
  	name: 'ashraf',
  	surname: 'khan',
	get fn() {
    	return this.name + ' ' + this.surname;
    },
  	set fn(fullName) {
		[this.name, this.surname] = fullName.split(' ');
	}
};
console.log(person.fn);
console.log(person.fn = 'arshad khan');
console.log(person.surname, person.name);
```
It's worth noticing that the second call to console.log prints `arshad khan`. This happens because set function returns the value that is returned by the get function for the same property, in this case `get fn`.


### Maps
One new feature that makes map really interesting is the possibility of using functions and objects as keys of map, and this is something that is not entirely possible using plain objects, because objects auto. casts all the keys to string. This opens new opportunities; for example, we can build a micro testing framework leveraging this feature:
```js
const tests = new Map();
tests.set(()=>2+2, 4);
tests.set(()=>2-2, 0);
for(const entry of tests) {
	console.log(entry[0]() === entry[1]);
}
```
**Note:** All the entries respect the order in which they are inserted.

## Chapter 2

### Defining globals
Even if all the variables and functions that are declare in a module are defined in its local scope, it i still possible to define az global variable. In fact, the module system exposes a special variabble called `global`, which can be used for this purpose. Everything that is assigned to this variable will end up automatically in the global scope.

### module.exports vs exports
The variable `export` is just a reference to the initial value of `module.exports`; we have seen that such a value is essentially a simple object literal created before the module is loaded.

### `require` function is synchronous
Therefore, this code is wrong -
```js
setTimeout(()=>{
    module.exports = () {...};
}, 100);
```
### `require.resolve(pathString)`
This method can be invoked to resolve module from path string.

### `require.cache`
The module cache is exposed via the `require.cache` variable, so it is possible to directly access it if needed. A common use case is to invalidate any cahced module by deleting the  relative key in the `require.cache` variable, a practive very useful during testing but very dangerous if applied in normal cicumstances.

### Circular Dependencies
Module a.js:
```js
"use strict";

exports.loaded = false;

const b = require('./b');

module.exports = {
  bWasLoaded: b.loaded,
  loaded: true
};
```

Module b.js:
```js
"use strict";

exports.loaded = false;

const a = require('./a');

module.exports = {
  aWasLoaded: a.loaded,
  loaded: true
};
```

Module main.js:
```js
"use strict";

const a = require('./a');
const b = require('./b');
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```

Results:
```
{bWasLoaded: true, loaded: true}
{aWasLoaded: false, loaded: true}
```

If main.js was -
```js
"use strict";

const b = require('./b');
const a = require('./a');
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
then results will be -
```
{bWasLoaded: false, loaded: true}
{aWasLoaded: true, loaded: true}
```

### Substack Pattern
```js
module.exports = (messsage) => {
    console.log(`info: ${message}`);
};

module.exports.verbose = (message) => {
    console.log(`verbose: ${message}`);
};

```

Expose the main functionality of a module by exporting only one function. Use the exported function as  namespace to expose any auxiliary functionality.

### Exporting a constructor or factory
```js
// file logger.js
function Logger(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Logger.prototype.log = function(message) {
    console.log(`[${this.name}]: ${message}`);
};

// file main.js
const Logger = require('./logger');
const dblogger = new Logger('DB');
dblogger.log('Some info!');
```

A variation of this pattern consists of applying a guard against invocations that doesn't use `new` instruction. This little trick allows us to use our module as a factory.
```js
// es5
function Logger(name) {
    if(!(this instanceof Logger)) {
        return new Logger(name);
    }

    this.name = name;
}

// es6
function Logger(name) {
    if(!new.target) {
        return new Logger(name);
    }

    this.name = name;
}
```

### Exporting an instance
Since the module is cached, every module that requires the `logger` module shares the same instance of the object, thus sharing its state. This pattern is very much like creating a singleton; however, it doesn't guarantee the uniqueness of the instance across the app, as it happens in traditional singleton pattern.
When analyzing the resolving alog, we have seen in fact, that a module might be installed multiple times inside the dependency tree of an app. This results in multiple  instances of the same logical module all running in the context of the same node.js app.

Moral of the story: don't export instances but export constructor instead.

### Monkey Patching
A module can modify other modules or objects in global scope; well, this is called **monkey patching**. It generally refers to the practice of modifying the existing objects at runtime to change or extend their behaviour or to apply temporary fixes.

Example:
```js
// patcher.js
require('./logger').customMethod = () => {...};

// main.js
require('./patcher');
const logger = require('./logger');
logger.customMethod(...);
```
In the preceding code, `patcher` must be required before using the `logger` module for the first time in order to allow the patch to be applied.

The techniques described here are all dangerous ones to apply. The main concern is that having a module that modifies the global namespce or other modules is an operation with side effects. In other words, it affects the state of entities outside their scope, which can have consequences that aren't predictable, especially when multiple modules interac with the same entities.

### Observer Pattern
**Pattern(observer)** defines an object(called subject), which can notify a set of observers(or listeners), when a change in its state happens. The main difference from the callback pattern is that the subject can actually notify multiple observers, while a traditional continuation-passing style callback will usually progate its result to only one listener, the callback.

### EventEmitter Class
In traditional OOP languages, the observer pattern requires concrete classes , and a heirarchy; in Node.js, all becomes simpler. The observer pattern is already built into the core and is abailable through the EventEmitter class.

The EventEmitter is a prototype and it is exported from the events core module.
```js
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const eeInstance = new EventEmitter();
```
Essential methods of the EventEmitter are as follows:
* on(event, listener)
* once(event, listener)
* emit(event, [arg1], [...])
* removeListener(event, listener)

We can already see that there is a big difference between a listener and a traditional Node.js callback; in particular, the first arg is not an error, but it can be any data passed to emit() at the moment of invocation.

### Creating and using EventEmitter
```js
const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const fs = require('fs');

function findPattern(files, reqex) {
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
...
...
    return emitter;
}

// using findPattern
findPattern(..., ...)
.on('fileread', ...)
.on('found', ...)
.on('error', ...);
```
**NOTE:** Make sure you always create a handler for error as without using it and throwing error will propogate to event loop and it will get lost.

### Making any object observable
```js
const  EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
const fs = require('fs');

class findPattern extends EventEmitter {
    constructor(regex) {
        super();
        this.regex = regex;
        this.files = [];
    }

    addFile(file) {
        this.files.push(file);
        // returning instance so that methods can be chained
        return this;
    }

    find() {
        this.files.forEach(file => {
            fs.readFile(... , ..., (err, content)=>{
                if(err)
                return this.emit('error', err);
                this.emit('fileread', file);

                let match = null;
                if(match = content.match(this.regex)) {
                    match.forEach(elem => this.emit('found', file, elem));
                }
            });

        });
        return this;
    }
}

// Using FindPattern

const findPatternObject = new FindPattern(/hello \w+/);

findPatternObject
    .add(...)
    .add(...)
    .find()
    .on('found', (file, match) => ...)
    .on('error', err => ...);
```

### Callback vs Emitter
```js
"use strict";

const EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;

function helloEvents() {
  let eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
  setTimeout(() => eventEmitter.emit('hello', 'hello world'), 100);
  return eventEmitter;
}

function helloCallback(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => callback('hello world'), 100);
}

helloEvents().on('hello', (message) => console.log(message));
helloCallback((message) => console.log(message));
```

**NOTE:** Combination of callback and EventEmitter can also exist, for ex - glob module.
